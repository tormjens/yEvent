{"name":"yEvent","tagline":"Open source Event Handling System","body":"### Welcome to yEvent\r\nyEvent is for you that's tried just about every event handling system out there. There are plugins for most CMS and there are expensive standalone solutions. None seem to cut it for a small- or mid-sized event or event organizer.\r\n\r\nIts a barebones open source solution built on open source software such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) with UI elements from the [Flat UI](http://designmodo.github.io/Flat-UI/) repository.\r\n\r\n### Customizable\r\nyEvent is made to be extendable. For instance: hosting a computer party? Install the seat-map module which lets you set up a seat map in just a couple of minutes. \r\n\r\n### Requirements\r\n* PHP\r\n* Apache\r\n* MySQL\r\n* jQuery\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nyEvent is developed and maintained by @tormjens.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with yEvent? Please submit an issue on the [issue page](http://github.com/tormjens/yEvent/issues).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
